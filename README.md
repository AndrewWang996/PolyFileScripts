These python scripts allow you to create .poly files in both 2 dimensions and 3 dimensions, in order to create 2D and 3D triangle and tetragonal meshes using Triangle and TetGen software. Created for the project team Magique3D at INRIA Bordeaux-Sud-Ouest, the scripts allow the user to define arbitrary interfaces between the acoustic (water) layer and the elastic (wet sand) layer as well as an arbitrary dip / slope of the salt dome in the 3D case.
